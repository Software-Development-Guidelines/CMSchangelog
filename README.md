# <a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction
**In CMS (WordPress, Joomla, Drupal) also exist the problem of the complements (Modules, Aplications, Plugins, Components, add-ons ...) where we need to take care of the code once we integrate our development in the CMS or if someone create an extension of our code.** We need to know what it change in order to know if it will affect the site.

Another problem we find is about keepachangelog, keepachangelog is too self code focus and some times the developers need more information.

As a solution to this problem, I propose a simple set of names and requirements that dictate how the notable changes are listed in a base of 6 words digit and several keywords and rules instead of the recomendations of [keepachangelog](http://keepachangelog.com/), in that way we give much more information in the release.

These rules are based on but not necessarily limited to pre-existing widespread common practices in use in both closed and open-source software.


I call this system ["CMS Changelog (CMSchangelog)"](/CHANGELOG.md) Under this scheme, change logs and the way they change convey meaning about the underlying code and what has been modified from one version to the next.
